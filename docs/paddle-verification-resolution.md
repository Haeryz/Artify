Our application was initially rejected by Paddle with the following message:

> We were unable to approve your domain, artify.haeryz.me.
>
> This may be because it does not comply with our Terms & Conditions, it does not meet our Acceptable Use Policy or was flagged as high risk.

> - Your pricing must be clearly displayed, including a list of features or deliverables the buyer will receive upon purchase (for that subscription period or as a one-off). Alternatively, you may provide a screenshot in response to this email if the page is not yet published
> - The product or service being sold via Paddle must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy and must not fall under prohibited categories

## Issues Identified

Based on the rejection message, we identified the following issues:

1. **Missing Business Identification**: The Terms & Conditions did not clearly identify the sole proprietor or company name (Hariz Faizul).

2. **Insufficient Service Description**: The website did not provide enough clarity about the actual service being provided, specifically that we're offering AI-powered photo editing using Google's Gemini API.

3. **Inadequate Pricing Information**: While we had pricing tiers, we needed to enhance the description of what users receive with each plan.

4. **Unclear Contact Information**: Our business contact details were incomplete.

## Resolution Steps

We made the following changes to resolve these issues:

### 1. Updated Terms & Conditions

- Added a prominent declaration that Artify is owned and operated by Hariz Faizul (sole proprietor)
- Added a new section specifically describing our service
- Enhanced contact information with complete business details
- Clarified the relationship between our service and the Google Gemini API

### 2. Enhanced Pricing Page

- Added clear service description at the top of the pricing page
- Included a "What is Artify?" section explaining our AI photo editing service
- Enhanced feature descriptions with specific details (e.g., resolution limits, number of templates)
- Added FAQ section addressing common questions
- Added payment processing information mentioning Paddle
- Included graphics explaining our core services

### 3. Updated Privacy & Refund Policies

- Added business identification to both policies
- Enhanced contact information with complete business details
- Added a specific section about AI technology usage
- Made all policies easily accessible through the navigation footer

### 4. Other Improvements

- Ensured all pages are mobile-friendly
- Added cross-links between policies for easy navigation
- Made sure our use of Google's Gemini API is clearly disclosed

## Resubmission Plan

After implementing these changes, we plan to:

1. Test all pages to ensure they load correctly and are accessible
2. Take screenshots of the updated pricing page to include in our response to Paddle
3. Specifically point out the changes made to address each issue in our resubmission
4. Provide Paddle with direct links to our Terms, Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, and Pricing pages

By clearly identifying the business owner, enhancing our service description, providing detailed pricing information, and ensuring all policies are easily accessible, we believe our application will meet Paddle's verification requirements.
